== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Everything will be served from the local server.

= Where can I find a working demo? =

Just head to http://prismjs.com for demos and instructions.

WP Database->wp-options->ank_prism_for_wp.

= This Plugin is unable to write js/css files . =

Each time update the settings, the plugin will create new js and CSS files.
